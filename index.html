							<p>This is how it all started. I booked flights to Siem Reap, a popular city in Northwestern Cambodia through <a href="http://www.bangkokair.com/" target="_blank">Bangkok Airlines</a>. Smile was a permanent expression on my face all through the tour of Cambodia and that expression involuntarily resurfaces whenever I think about the times spent in Cambodia. For people who don't know me, being an introvert, I don't smile as often as average person!!! But the vibe of the people of Cambodia and their joie-de-vivre culture is highly contagious. But there’s another not so happy side to Cambodia. It was ravaged by Khmer Rouge (Communist rule in Cambodia) regime that killed most of the population and also wiped out several important cultural symbols. The Khmer Rouge's regime destroyed Cambodia not just economically but also socially.
								<br/><br/>But despite all the odds, hats off to the people of Cambodia for bouncing back the way they have. The warmth and zeal of the people of the country have help them in forgetting the bitter memories of past. Ever since the tourism industry in Cambodia is growing rapidly.
								<br/><br/>I was attracted to Cambodia because it's an interesting melange of ancient and modern worlds that creates a truly adventurous experience and mesmerizingly magical. The present Cambodia was formerly part of the great Khmer Empire, consisting of what is now Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The glimpses of their glorious past can be seen at the fabled temples of Angkor, which is one of the largest monuments in the world. The Cambodian culture has influences of many Asian cultures, alongside those of France and the United States. The temples constitute an integral part of the Cambodian culture, therefore several temples built between 9th and 13th Century AD are found across the Country.</p>
							<br/><p><b><u><i>Places to Visit:</i></u></b></p>
							<p><b><u>ANGKOR</u></b></p>
							<p>Angkor, is one of the most important archaeological sites of Southeast Asia and also my reference point to Cambodia. The monument is the epitome to the rich and cultural heritage of the country It extends over approximately 400 square kilometres and consists of scores of temples, hydraulic structures (basins, dykes, reservoirs, canals) as well as communication routes. For several centuries during the Khmer era, the town of Angkor was the hub of all the activities.  The monument is distinct because of several architectural spectacles like, several different ancient urban plans and large water reservoirs. Temples such as Angkor Wat, the Bayon, Preah Khan and Ta Prohm, exemplars of Khmer architecture, not only reflect the cultural sophistication but also are much more than simply having a symbolic significance. Angkor is therefore a major site exemplifying cultural, religious and symbolic values, as well as containing high architectural, archaeological and artistic significance. Angkor was the vast capital city of the Khmer Empire, which ruled over much of Southeast Asia from the 9th to 15th centuries. The city is said to have population of up to 1 million people at the peak of Khmer rule.</p>
							<p><b><u>ANGKOR WAT</u></b></p>
							<p>	If Angkor is the crown of Cambodia, Angkor wat is certainly the most precious jewel in that crown. So, when a trip to Cambodia came up, a visit to majestic Angkor Wat was first thing on my to do list. Angkor Wat, simply meaning The Temple City, nothing else can explain the significance of the temple than referring the city by its temple. Angkor Wat is just one of the 50 plus Angkor temples in the Angkor Archaeological Park and Siem Reap Province. Angkor Wat is the most famous of all the remaining Angkor temples today, being the best-preserved thanks mainly to continual use since its construction in the 12th century.
								<br/><br/>The enchanting sunsets are major attraction at Angkor wat, so I arrived before dawn to experience it over the massive temple. The group of tourist appeared like colony of ants led by their guides, around the area’s temples. I followed my lead ant ruins walking carefully on the cobblestone. The best shot is from the left pond in front of Angkor Wat to capture the reflection of dawn is also the most difficult one, because that’s where there is maximum crowd but nevertheless, go for the kill, it's totally worth it!  Walking across the moat into the temple I was overwhelmed by the aura of the place and being finally able to see one of the most mesmerising structure of ancient art and architecture in the world.
								<br/><br/>Also, don’t miss the staircase that leads you up to the higher level under the towers, to my mind it appeared like a stairway leading to another world, perhaps to the glorious day of the city that now lies in ruins. The calm atop the stairs is contrary to the hustle bustle of tourist below.</p>
							<p><img src="img/Cambodia/Angkor%20Wat.jpg" width="100%"></p><br/>
							<p><b><u>ANGKOR THOM</u></b></p>
							<p>	The capital city of the Khmer empire built at the end of the 12thcentury. It incorporates elements of Hinduism, Buddhism and local animist beliefs. With massive faces looking down upon you, one gets a spooky feeling of being watched over. The faces as told by my guide, belong to the god-king Jayavarman VII, who is also responsible for constructing this temple.  After the decline of Khmer Kingdom, the city was deserted and lost to the jungle until it was rediscovered in 19th century by French explorers, soon after which the EFEO (the École Française d'Extrême-Orient) who later restored the both the monument and several tales associated with it. The causeway of the temple is flanked by 54 gods and 54 demons depicting parts of the popular Hindu legend “The Churning of the Ocean of Milk”.
								<br/><br/>Nothing got me so close to the feeling of being Indiana Jones as the Angkor Thom, while crossing the bridge I felt like I was part of the treasure hunt team as depicted in famous Hollywood movies. Like other Khemer structures, the bridge is flanked by gigantic scale carvings of divas and ashuras, figures from mythology. The name means Great City, an epithet as meaningful today as when it was first built in the 12th century. Not just one temple, but truly a city comprised of a variety of buildings, so surely it’s a day filled with adventure of exploring each structure and tales associated with it. Angkor Thom reveals the influence the Khmer Empire once swayed over South East Asia.
								<br/><br/>To me, the experience at Angkor Thom was different from one at Angkor Wat. It will be foolish to anticipate a similar experience. A quite tree-lined path to the inner circle of the temple was the last and most enduring capital city of the Khmer empire. Angkor Thom will surely surprise you in more than one ways! </p>

							<p><b><u>BANTEAY SREI (Citadel of the Women)</u></b></p>
							<p>	Unlike other Khmer Temples, Banteay Srei was not built by a king but by a Brahmin, who was a spiritual guide to Khemer king in honour of Lord Shiva. There’s another interesting folklore about the temple i.e. Banteay Srei, which also means “Citadel of Women,” is speculated that women built the temple as its intricate designs and adornments are too fine to be carved by hands of men.  Built in 10th century which is earlier than Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei’s beauty lies in  the way it has been preserved. This temple is around 25 km north of the main temples of Angkor. The use of wonderful pinkish stone and the intricate carvings makes it different from other temples of Angkor. Being at distance from Angkor temples it also gives a hidden gem feeling as not many visit this temple but I’d recommend adding this to your ‘must see’ list.
								<br/><br/>The detailed carvings of apsaras, celestial nymphs in Hindu tradition, adorn the walls prominently tells stories from Mahabharata and Ramayana adding to its mystical aura. The site also a great example of old monument having all the modern basic amenities like modern toilets, shop, visitor centre and cafe.</p>

							<p><img src="img/Cambodia/Angkor7.jpg" width="100%"></p><br/>
							<p><b><u>PRE RUP TEMPLE</u></b></p>
							<p>When I arrived at the site, from distance it appeared to be rouble but as I got nearer the beauty of Pre Rup Temple became clearer. The exact history of Temple is not known but the popular belief is that this temple was used for funeral ceremonies. “Pre Rup” translates to “turn the body”, which coincides with ancient Khmer funerary practices of rotating a person’s ashes during the funeral ceremony.  Heavily ornamental lintels and use of laterite rocks gives is what makes Pre Rup stands out. I was surprised to see pyramid like summit, climbing it was tough task but view atop the summit made it definitely worth the effort. It offers panoramic view of the entire site, truly breath-taking.
								<br/><br/>I also spotted several small Buddhist shrines with offerings and incense since Pre Rup is still used by many as place of worship. Don’t know about the practise of turning body during cremation but I feel there are lots of things  at Pre Rup, that will make you turn your head more than once.</p>
							<p><img src="img/Cambodia/Angkor5.jpg" width="100%"></p><br/>
							<p><b><u>TA PROHM TEMPLE</u></b></p>
							<p>	A visit to Cambodia is not just about the magnificent Angkor Wat, but there are many temples across the country that are equally marvellous. The Ta Prohm Temple is just an example one such temple. Like, the other temples this is not merely a temple but a testimonial to the illustrious Cambodian culture. The entire temple structure is maze like entwined by barks of ancient trees, and one fails to distinguish between the two. the trees appear to be embracing the temple in a loving embrace and the temple shows its love by accommodating the trees unconditionally. Certainly, making the Ta Prohm one of the most exquisite and expressive temples.
								<br/><br/>My local guide who was also a movie buff like me very excitedly announced that the Ta Prohm is the very temple that featured in Angelina Jolie film, The Tomb Raider, hence popularly also known as the Angelina Jolie Temple.  To me it appeared like a trail of Temple Run game, with dark hallways and doorways. The temple was built for more than 250 deities and the principal deity, Prajnaparamita, referred to the Perfection of Wisdom. The past is reflected in some of the bass reliefs in the shrines. The Ta Prohm Temple is an epitome of perfect and peaceful synergy of nature’s art and man-made art, one can’t help but simply marvel at this masterpiece.</p>

							<p>They say sometimes the journey is more enthralling than the final destination. During the road trip to Sikkim a very small but diverse state, I can very confidently say that there was an intense competition between the two to outplay each other. The journey with fellow bikers marked by scenic landscapes of lush green Himalayas and pristine waterfalls, interesting but weird conversations and to top it all the perfect weather to ride will always reserve a special place in me. The cruising Royal Enfield was fueled by the enthusiasm of the riders managed to jump over every hurdle that threatened its momentum. From negotiating for permits to strict laws of the state, from fuel scare at 12000 feet to stony bumpy roads to Gurudongmar lake, to losing my balance for the first time in my biking career to having gained a friendships that I know will last a lifetime, the journey was as action packed as it could get. The thrills of journey were maximise by the beauty of the destinations. The urbane and classy Gangtok, the mystical and quite lachung valley, the frozen beauty of Gurudongmar lake, the colorful and snowy yumthang valley and the mammoth zuluk la pass, each of them way better than what we had imagine. The warming hospitality of the people of Sikkim deserves a special thank you, they were our guides and at times saviour on these new and confusing roads. To wind up, I know there have been and will be numerous road trips in life but biking trip to Sikkim will always have special place in our hearts the journey of six days has given memories that shall be cherished for lifetime.</p>
							<br/><p><b>Zuluk La:</b></p>
							<p>Zuluk la, was an integral part of the silk route trade is abode of peace with a enchanting view of Kanchenjunga, only if zuluk could speak abt the stories it has witnessed! Nevertheless the place still has the ability to transmit you to an ancient era.</p>
